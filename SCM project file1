      </figure>
          <p><b> Alpha variant, also known as lineage B.1.1.7, is a variant of SARS-CoV-2
            the virus that causes COVID-19. One of several variants of concern, the variant, 
            is estimated to be 40–80% more transmissible than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2.
            It was first detected in November 2020 from a sample taken in September in the
            United Kingdom, and began to spread quickly by mid-December,
            around the same time as infections surged. This increase is thought to be at least
            partly because of one or more mutations in the virus' spike protein.
            As of January 2021, more than half of all genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was 
            carried out in UK. 
            This has given rise to questions as to how many other important variants may
            be circulating around the world undetected.
            On 2 February 2021, Public Health England reported that they had detected "[a] limited 
            number of B.1.1.7 VOC-202012/01 genomes with E484K mutations",
            which they dubbed Variant of Concern 202102/02 (VOC-202102/02). 
            On 31 May 2021, the World Health Organization announced that the Variant of
            Concern would be labelled "Alpha" for use in public communications</b>

          <p><b>
            The Beta variant, also known as lineage B.1.351, is a variant of SARS-CoV-2,
            the virus that causes COVID-19.
            One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed to be of particular importance, 
            it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area of the
            Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October 2020, which was reported
            by the country's health department on 18 December 2020. Phylogeographic
            analysis suggests this variant emerged in the Nelson Mandela Bay area in
            July or August 2020.The E484K spike mutation was linked to a case of
            reinfection with the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, believed by
            researchers to be the first such case of reinfection involving this mutation.
            The World Health Organization labelled the variant as Beta variant, not to
            replace the scientific name but as a name for the public to commonly refer
            to.The WHO considers it to be a variant of concern.

            The Gamma variant, also known as lineage P.1, is one of the variants of SARS-CoV-2,
            the virus that causes COVID-19. This variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been named lineage 
            P.1 and has 17 amino acid substitutions, ten of which in its spike protein, including 
            these three designated to be of particular concern: N501Y, E484K and K417T. This 
            variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first detected by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases
            (NIID) of Japan, on 6 January 2021 in four people who had arrived in Tokyo having visited 
            Brazil, four days earlier. It was subsequently declared to be in circulation in
            Brazil.Under the simplified naming scheme proposed by the World Health Organization,
            P.1 has been labeled Gamma variant, and is currently considered a variant of concern.
            Gamma caused widespread infection in early 2021 in the city of Manaus, the capital
            of Amazonas, although the city had already experienced widespread infection in May 2020, 
            with a study indicating high seroprevalence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.

          The Delta variant is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
          It was first detected in India in late 2020. The Delta variant was named on 31 May 2021
          and had spread to over 179 countries by 22 November 2021. The World Health Organization
          (WHO) indicated in June 2021 that the Delta variant is becoming the dominant strain
          globally.It has mutations in the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
          causing the substitutions T478K, P681R and L452R, which are known to affect
          transmissibility of the virus as well as whether it can be neutralised by antibodies
          for previously circulating variants of the COVID-19 virus. It is thought to be

        <p><b>
          The Omicron variant is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
          It was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from South Africa 
          on 24 November 2021. On 26 November 2021, the WHO designated it as a variant
          of concern and named it omicron, the fifteenth letter in the Greek alphabet
          The variant has an unusually large number of mutations, several of which are
          novel and a significant number of which affect the spike protein targeted by
          most COVID-19 vaccines at the time of discovering theOmicron variant. This 
          level of variation has led to concerns regarding its transmissibility, immune 
          system evasion, and vaccine resistance. As a result,the variant was quickly
          designated as being "of concern", and travel restrictions were introduced by
          several countries in an attempt to slow its international spread.
          However, the variant has spread to over 70 countries as of 13 December 2021.
